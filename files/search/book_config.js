This is approved by the General Assembly, and in 2016 itwas equivalent to about 4 per cent of OCHA’s overall budget. OCHA also usescost-recovery mechanisms to finance the management of its pooled funds andadministrative services, but more than 90 per cent of its budget must be fundedby voluntary contributions from Member States. OCHA thus depends on donors’generous voluntary and annual or multi-year contributions to carry out its mandatedtasks.
